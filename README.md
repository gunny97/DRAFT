## Abstract
With the growing volume of diverse information, the demand for classifying arbitrary topics has become increasingly critical. To address this challenge, we introduce DRAFT, a simple framework designed to train a classifier for few-shot topic classification. DRAFT uses a few examples of a specific topic as queries to construct Customized dataset with a dense retriever model. Multi-query retrieval (MQR) algorithm, which effectively handles multiple queries related to a specific topic, is applied to construct the Customized dataset. Subsequently, we fine-tune a classifier using the Customized dataset to identify the topic. To demonstrate the efficacy of our proposed approach, we conduct evaluations on both widely used classification benchmark datasets and manually constructed datasets with 291 diverse topics, which simulate diverse contents encountered in real-world applications. DRAFT shows competitive or superior performance compared to baselines that use in-context learning, such as GPT-3 175B and InstructGPT 175B, on few-shot topic classification tasks despite having 177 times fewer parameters, demonstrating its effectiveness.

(a) Overall pipeline of DRAFT. DRAFT receives n queries as input, and a trained classifier is only used in the test phase.

For each query, passages only within an angle size θ, calculated as a threshold from n query vectors, are retrieved as positive samples, while others are classified as negative samples.
